2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net MINESWEEP/moveTraker[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MINESWEEP/MOVE_FSM.moveTraker_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell MINESWEEP/MOVE_FSM.moveTraker_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net MINESWEEP/moveTraker[10] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MINESWEEP/MOVE_FSM.moveTraker_reg[10]_i_2/O, cell MINESWEEP/MOVE_FSM.moveTraker_reg[10]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
